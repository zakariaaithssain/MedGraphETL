      "content": "MedGraphETL is an end-to-end ETL pipeline that builds a biomedical knowledge graph from biomedical articles. The extracted data is transformed into a graph structure and loaded into a Neo4j instance, where it can be explored and queried. The frontend only provides a high-level exploration of the graph.\nNote:\nThis project uses SciSpacy for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and spaCy matchers for Relation Extraction (RE).\nThe extracted data is not reviewed or validated by medical professionals."
